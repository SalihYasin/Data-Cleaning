# DATA-CLEANING
 
 ## Introduction
 This project has been prepared to give other users an idea about how I can organize data, highlight the desired data and clean unnecessary data using SQL. Feel free to explore the scripts and adapt them for your own projects. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

 ### Project List:
 - Nashville Housing Data

 ## Problem Statement

In Data Analysis, the analyst must ensure that the data is 'clean' before doing any analysis.  'Dirty' data can lead to unreliable, inaccurate and/or misleading results.  Garbage in = garbage out.

In this project, the procedures that should be suitable for the relevant data set and that I applied are as follows:

- Standardize Date Format
- Populate Property Address data
- Breaking out Address into Individual Columns (Address, City, State)
- Change Y and N to Yes and No in "Sold as Vacant" field
- Remove Duplicates
- Delete Unused Columns
- Remove extra spaces and/or other invalid characters.
- Check for null or empty values.

  ## Datasets used

- Basic select statements (select, where, group by, having).
- Aggregate functions (count, sum, min, max, avg)
- Joins (inner, outer, left, right)
- CTE's, temp tables and views
- string & date manipulation functions.
- Window functions (rank, lead, lag, row_number, ntile...)
